## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
```clarity
skills                -> Available certification categories
assessments           -> Active skill evaluation processes
validator-endorsements -> Individual validator evaluations
user-certifications   -> Earned credentials and badges
validators            -> Expert validator network
user-profiles         -> Professional achievement tracking
```

### Certification Flow
1. **Assessment Start**: User pays fee and begins evaluation
2. **Validator Review**: Multiple experts provide scores and feedback
3. **Consensus**: System calculates final score from validator inputs
4. **Certification**: Passing scores earn NFT badges and credentials

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Skill Seekers

1. **Browse Skills**: Explore available certification categories
   ```clarity
   (get-skill skill-id)
   ```

2. **Start Assessment**: Begin skill evaluation process
   ```clarity
   (start-assessment skill-id)
   ```

3. **Get Validated**: Expert validators review your submission
4. **Earn Certificate**: Receive NFT badge for passing scores

### For Validators

1. **Join Network**: Admin adds qualified validators
2. **Review Assessments**: Evaluate candidate submissions
   ```clarity
   (validate-assessment assessment-id score feedback)
   ```

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Software Development Certification
```
1. Alice starts "React.js Developer" assessment (0.5 STX fee)
2. Submits portfolio and code samples for evaluation
3. 3 expert validators review: scores 85, 78, 92
4. Average score: 85 (passes 70% threshold)
5. Alice receives "React.js Developer" NFT badge
```

### Design Skills Validation
```
1. Bob seeks "UX Design" certification
2. 5-day assessment period with portfolio submission
3. Validators provide scores and detailed feedback
4. Score: 68 (below 70% threshold) - assessment fails
5. Bob can retake assessment after improving skills
```

### Validator Participation
```
1. Carol becomes validator for "Data Science" skills
2. Reviews 15 assessments over 2 months
3. Reputation score increases from 100 to 175
